This repository contains code and documentation for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of iris flowers' features and their corresponding species.

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to conduct EDA on the Iris dataset to gain insights into the data's structure, distributions, and relationships between features. EDA is an essential step in the data analysis process, helping us understand the dataset and prepare for modeling tasks such as classification.

# Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of the following features:

Sepal length (in centimeters)
Sepal width (in centimeters)
Petal length (in centimeters)
Petal width (in centimeters)
The dataset contains samples of three species of iris flowers:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

# Contents
eda_iris.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for performing EDA on the Iris dataset.
iris.csv: CSV file containing the Iris dataset.

# Results
The EDA process reveals insights into the distributions of features, relationships between features, and patterns in the data that may be useful for further analysis and modeling tasks.

# Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

Pandas,
NumPy,
Matplotlib'
Seaborn


# Acknowledgments
This project utilizes the Iris dataset, which is widely used in the machine learning community.
Inspiration for this project came from the need to understand and explore the characteristics of the Iris dataset for educational and analysis purposes.
